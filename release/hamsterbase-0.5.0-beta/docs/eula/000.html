IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE TERMS, DO NOT DOWNLOAD, INSTALL OR USE THE SOFTWARE. THE SOFTWARE MAY NOT BE SOLD, TRANSFERRED, OR FURTHER DISTRIBUTED WITHOUT PRIOR WRITTEN AUTHORIZATION FROM HamsterBase.</p>
<p>This HamsterBase End User License Agreement for Beta Software (“Beta Agreement”) together with any Supplemental HamsterBase License Agreement included with the Software constitutes a legal agreement between You (an entity or a person) and HamsterBase LLC (“HamsterBase”). The software product(s) accompanying this Beta Agreement, software updates, media (if any) and accompanying online or printed documentation (collectively the “Software”) is protected by the copyright laws and treaties of the China and other countries and is subject to the terms of this Beta Agreement. If You do not agree with the terms of this Beta Agreement, do not download, install or otherwise use the Software and, if applicable, return the entire unused package to HamsterBase. The Software is licensed to You, not sold.</p>
<p>The Software may include or be bundled with other software programs licensed under different terms and/or licensed by a licensor other than HamsterBase. The terms of an end user license agreement accompanying a particular software file upon installation or download of the software shall supersede the terms presented below. Third party software programs are provided for use at Your option. HamsterBase is not responsible for any third party’s software and shall have no liability for Your use of third party software.</p>
<p>The Software may include components that are open source packages, developed independently, and accompanied by separate license terms. Your license rights with respect to individual components accompanied by separate license terms are defined by those terms; nothing in this Agreement shall restrict, limit, or otherwise affect any rights or obligations You may have, or conditions to which You may be subject, under such license terms. While the license terms for a component may authorize You to distribute the component, You may not use any HamsterBase marks (e.g., HamsterBase ) in distributing the component, whether or not the component contains HamsterBase marks.</p>
<p><strong>License.</strong> Subject to the terms and conditions of this Beta Agreement, HamsterBase grants You a non-exclusive, non-transferable right to reproduce and internally use the Software during the Term specified below in a quantity as reasonably necessary to perform Your evaluation and/or testing of the Software.</p>
<p>If a HamsterBase product separate to the product provided for beta testing is included in or with the Software, then notwithstanding the license rights in the license agreement accompanying the copy of that separate HamsterBase product, You agree to use the separate HamsterBase product solely in connection with and solely for the purpose of Your evaluation of the Software. Your right to use the separate HamsterBase product software terminates upon termination of the Beta Agreement as specified below.</p>
<p><strong>Term.</strong> This Beta Agreement becomes effective on the date You legally acquire the Software and will remain in force until terminated as follows.

Upon termination of this Beta Agreement, You must cease use of the Software, return to an original state any actions performed by the Software, destroy the original and all copies of the Software or return them to HamsterBase, and delete the Software entirely from Your systems.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-Release Quality.</strong> Since the Software is of pre-release quality, You should not use the Software in a commercial or production system. The Software has not been fully tested and may contain errors and omissions. The Software should be used only in a testing environment. HamsterBase does not guarantee that a commercial version of the Software will become generally available to the public, that target dates will be met, or that associated products will be released. The entire risk arising out of Your use of the Software remains with You. The Software may contain an automatic disabling mechanism that prevents its use after a certain period of time, so You should back up Your system and take other measures to prevent any loss of files or data. Use of the Software is entirely at Your own risk.</p>
<p><strong>Confidentiality.</strong> (This section applies to You unless HamsterBase has released the Software to the general public as an open beta without obligation of confidentiality.) The Software and all embodied concepts, accompanying documentation and materials, product features, test and evaluation results, benchmark results, target dates, PIN numbers and passwords, and all other related information are proprietary and confidential information of HamsterBase and its suppliers and are referred to herein as “Confidential Information”. You agree not to disclose or provide any Confidential Information to any third party or use the Confidential Information for any purpose other than testing or evaluating the Software and providing feedback to HamsterBase. If provided a PIN number or password to access restricted sites, You agree not to share the PIN number or password with any third party. Your obligations of confidentiality shall survive termination of this Beta Agreement until the date HamsterBase makes such information publicly available.</p>
